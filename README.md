  Deposit Section:
        The deposit Button creates a new window for making a deposit. It includes a label, an entry field for entering the             deposit amount, a deposit button, and a result label to display the transaction result. The deposit amount is added            to the account balance when the "Deposit" button is pressed.

  Withdraw Section:
        The Withdraw Button creates a new window for making a withdrawal. It includes a label, an entry field for entering             the withdrawal amount, a withdrawal button, and a result label to display the transaction result. The withdrawal               amount is subtracted from the account balance when the "Withdraw" button is pressed.

  Balance Enquiry Section:
        The balance_enquiry Button displays the account balance in a label on the main application window. It toggles the              visibility of the balance label when the "Balance Enquiry" button is pressed.
